TCP/IP - allows you to get data from point a to point b
         data can take various paths, some more direct thant others

IP - Internet Protocol - protocol that allows computers to talk to each other
                         all computers have unique adresses (4 numbers, each from 0-255 32-bits in total allows for ~4 bilion computers on the internet wasy around this)
                         IP adress used to send from one computer to another

TCP - Transmission Control Protocol - protocols computers use to distiguish different services from each other
                                      common services include HTTP represented by 80 and HTTPS (the secure version) represented by 443
                                      these serve as port numbers that the data will be routed to when sent to an IP adress

TCP/IP alows you do downoad an image or video in smaller chunks rather than all at once
image would be sent with IP adress, the code to identify the service and the port it should be routed to, what part of the image out of the total to know how to reassemble it
recieving computer will then reply to the sending computer that it recieved everhything ot is missing something



DNS - Domain Name System - Converts domain names to IP adresses
                           functions like a hash table with server IP adresses as keys and the domain names and values


HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol - a service that runs on top of the internet, like email or zoom
                                      used to build services that run on the internet


https://www.example.com/ - ending with a / takes you to the root or default file
                                         /file.html will take you to that file
                                         /folder/ shows whats in the folder
                                         /folfer/file.html whats in the file in the folder
                            www.example.com is th fully qualified domanin name
                            example.com is the domain name
                            .com is the Top Level Domain (TLD)
                            www is the host name
                            https is the scheme/protocol that indicated what protocol should be used to acess the data


keywords will be sent from computer to computer
GET - get information
POST - upload information

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
..................

in command line:

curl -I https://www.example.com/
show the header values fom the website used

http-server
will create a server to run the file through your browser







html - hyper text markup language - good creating aesthetics and data but not a programming function with no programming logic
                                    has two features

css - Cascading Style Sheets - liek html is not a programming language but used for the aesthetics of webpages
