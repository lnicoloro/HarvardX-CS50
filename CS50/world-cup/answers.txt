Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

For N = 10 and 100 had most difference in predictions from all the other simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

Either N = 1000 or N = 10000 both are accurate like simulations with larger N values but use drastically less time
