flask is a python frame-work / library (kinda like bootstrap was for css) used to help make web applications

command line:
flask run

will need these files:
app.py - where all the python code goes
templates/ - folder where the templates go (html files)
requirements.txt - allows you to use third party conventions
static/ - where the static content goes (images, videos, javascript files, css files)




using post will send to the server without showing in url
get will use the url


request.args only works for GET
request.form only works for POST



API - application programming interface - any finction from c python scratch stc are api's, somtimes have arguments or return values,
                                        also web based ones to get data liek weather data or a book dastabase
